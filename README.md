# gmm_shape_classification
I use the gmm (Gaussian Mixture Model) and the shape index from the paper "Classification and Extraction of Spatial Features in Urban Areas Using High-Resolution Multispectral Imagery" to classify object on the Remote-sensing image.

This method is pixel-based classification.
I use gdal to read multi-band image and use the Eigen to do the matrix computation.
